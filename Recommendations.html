          <h4>I would recommend a few changes to this game's interface. Most notably, the lack of a quit button in the game makes for an annoying user experience when trying to exit and close the game.
         This would be a simple feat to achieve given that to close a game all is required is a simple function connected to a simple button. This could even be accomplished without a button, if the game accepted the escape key as a method of quitting the game then I believe that would suffice.</h4>

        <section>
          <h4> Another design change I would suggest is perhaps an outline to the objects which can/will kill the player. This is due to the fact that most people's criticisms towards the game were based on the fact that they couldn't tell where they were going to be hit from.
         Some might argue this is an intentional design choice. 
         Regardless of whether or not this is true, it detracted from the player's enjoyment of the game and at the end of the day, the enjoyment of the player is paramount.</h4>
