          <h4>Judging by the results I have received from the questionnaire, the interview and the observations I have done; I conclude that the players who
         had more gaming experience were more likely to enjoy the game. This is contrary to what I first believed to be the case; the less experienced the player the more they would enjoy it. Going by the idea that ignorance is bliss.
         Perhaps this suggests that due to the nature of the game and the mechanics, it requires a lot of tolerance and understanding of the core principles behind creating the game.</h4>
