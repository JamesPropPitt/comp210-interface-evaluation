          <h4>Since the results I received were so different from the hypothesis I started off with this could mean that the methodology I implemented was able to gather results in an unbiased manner.
		  These results could be used to help the developers of this game further improve their product by analysing not only the responses but also the type of people who gave the results so that they can alter
		  their demographic acccordingly. Furthermore my methodology could have been made more reliable by including more than 1 observational piece of evidence, the lack of observational evidence could be seen to undermine
		  the integrity of my other results. </h4>

          <h4> Another factor that is interesting to note is that the questionnaire which was sent out en masse recorded the answer no to every question about whether or not they felt immersed, except for 1 response.
However, this response may have been from an ingenuine client as they produced results which were not only anomalous to all the others but also rated everything in the questionnaire with a 10. That aside, perhaps the immersion question
was a poor choice as it was unlikely from the start that many people would feel immersed in a game with no narrative or VR capabilities. A grand majority of players tended to find the objective of the game clear as that seemed to be the highest rated response.	  </h4>
