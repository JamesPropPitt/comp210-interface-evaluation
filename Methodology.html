          I intend to test the interface of this game through a questionnaire which will be put together
          based on the results from various face to face interviews based on the play testing of the game.
          The information collected shall be displayed in a graph to visually ascertain the correlation, or lack thereof, in the results.
          
          There are three avenues of questioning which I will explore:
           <ul>
            <li> Observing the player interact with the game</li>
            <li> Asking the player questions directly after they have just play tested the game</li>
            <li> Creating a questionnaire based on the answers provided by the face to face interview</li>
           </ul>
           I shall observe the player while they play the game and note down anything they say and occassionally ask them questions while they are in the game.
           After they are ready to stop playing and answer some of the questions I have for them, we will proceed with that.
           Finally, using the responses and feedback they have given me from playing the game I shall create a questionnaire based on the feedback to issue to more people playing the game.
           These results will then be made into a graph or other data displaying devices for user consumption and further game development.
